# digitalCV

This is a project of a digital CV made with some of my current HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. Since I have limited knowledge of these three, I wanted to present myself with my paintings as I am more comfortable with showing them now. 
The online CV has two break points: IphoneX and Ipad responsiveness. The default responsivity is on wide screen which is wider or equal to 1300px. 
Instagram, Behance and Facebook are linked in case visitors are curious about what I do or who I am.
There is color change with hover on the "Hi! I'm Nisa, Illustrator." There is also a simple slider of 4 images which disappears on IphoneX size. One last thing I want to mention is the Contact form that is linked to the Navigation bar's 'Contact' and main body's 'Hire Me' items. They also have a hover that gives them a more vibrant color.
